          Since 1994, I&apos;ve been fully immersed in the world of music production
          and mixing, working in both live settings and studios to help artists
          achieve the sound they&apos;ve always envisioned. My journey began in
          Michigan, where I grew up, and after high school, I went on to study
          classical guitar with a focus on theory and composition at Spring Arbor
          University. These studies gave me a deep understanding of the technical
          and emotional aspects of music, which continues to shape my approach to
          every project.

          In 1994, I made the move to Nashville, TN, and have been working
          non-stop in the studio as a producer and mix engineer. Over the years,
          I&apos;ve had the privilege of collaborating with a diverse array of artists,
          including Lee Greenwood, Joey Belladonna of Anthrax (Beyond Frontiers),
          Phenix Red, Chris West, and the Mixtape 80&apos;s Tribute Band, to name just
          a few.

          My love for a great mix started before I even knew it. Without realizing
          it, I found myself drawn as much to the production and mix of a song as
          to the music itself. When I discovered music that had both—a perfect
          blend of artistry and sonic clarity—I was hooked. Albums like Steely
          Dan&apos;s <em>Aja</em> and Toy Matinee were the catalysts for my journey of
          critical listening, and they remain key influences on my work. Figuring
          out exactly why those records sound so incredible has been a lifelong
          passion of mine, and now, helping you bring your music to life
          is what I do.

          To me, mixing is an art form, but it&apos;s also deeply collaborative. My
          role as a mix engineer is to connect with you on a musical level,
          understanding the nuances of your vision, so I can deliver a sonic
          quality that elevates your art without compromising its original intent.
          Every song, every project, is unique, and I take pride in crafting mixes
          that not only sound great but also resonate emotionally and stand the
          test of time.
